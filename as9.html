<a id="id1"><h1>COMPUTER</h1></a>
<br>
<a href="#idtop">GO TO TOP</a><br>
<p>an electronic device which is capable of receiving information in a particular form and of performing a sequence of operations in accordance with a predetermined but variable set of procedural instructions to produce a result in the form of information or signals.</p>
<p><a id="id2"><b>cpu</b></a></p>
<p>The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the computer component that's responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's other hardware and software.</p>
<p><a id="id3"><b>ALU</b></a></p>
<p>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).</p>
<a id="id4"><h1>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h1></a>
<br>
<a href="#idtop">GO TO TOP</a><br>
<p>A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</p>
<p><a id="id5"><b>C</b></a></p>
<p>C is a computer programming language. That means that you can use C to create lists of instructions for a computer to follow. C is one of thousands of programming languages currently in use. C has been around for several decades and has won widespread acceptance because it gives programmers maximum control and efficiency.</p>
<p><a id="id6"><b>C++</b></a></p>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</p>

<div id="id7"><h1>DBMS</h1></div><br>

<a href="#idtop">GO TO TOP</a><br>
<p>DBMS means Database Management System, which is a concept and a set of rules that all or major Database Systems follows. Some Database systems follows most of these rules, and some follows only only certain rules.</p>
<p><a id="id8"><b>RDBMS</b></a></p>
<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that lets you create, update, and administer a relational database. Most commercial RDBMS's use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to access the database, although SQL was invented after the development of the relational model and is not necessary for its use.</p>
<p><a id="id9"><b>OODBMS</b></a></p>
<p>An object database (also object-oriented database management system, OODBMS) is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming.</p>
<p><a id="id10"><b>HDBMS</b></a></p>
<p>A DBMS is said to be hierarchical DBMS, when the data is organized like a tree structure. That means, it simply represents the data using parent â€“ child relationship. It is the oldest style of organizing data and still some organizations are using this.</p>
<p><a id="id11"><b>NWDBMS</b></a></p>
<p>This path stands for creativity, adaptability, expression, sociability, originality, sensitivity and communication. But it also symbolizes vanity, superficiality, arrogance, dispersion and discouragement.</p>
